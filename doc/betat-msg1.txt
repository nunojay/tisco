  Hi there,
  you have all accepted to test a TI C compiler: 
  TISCO - TI Simple C Compiler version 0.0.
  Only now I realised I forgot to tell something important in
  the first mail, but since it was an ASM86 mailing list it
  shouldn't be no problem: a TI-86 (86) is needed, at least to
  test every option.
  I asked people with some assembly skills because that will
  be essential in understanding the code generated.
  TISCO compiles a small set of C, with a few restrictions.
  It compiles 'normal' programs and DLLs. For those who know
  Turbo Pascal, TISCO will generate code with aproximated
  quality to what TP generates in the PC.
  Don't expect too much from it, but besides it's limitations
  I think it has it's usefullness.

  I have the compiler in a ZIP, it's a 218Kb WinZIP file.
  You will find there the manual. Just unzip it to a ...\TISCO\
  directory. Start by reading TISCO00.TXT.
  Now I wait a message from each of you allowing me to send
  you the ZIP by mail, or telling if you prefer other way,
  or if you have given up.

  Bye
