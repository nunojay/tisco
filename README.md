# tisco
Old z80 simple C compiler for TI based calculators.

This project was developed end of 1998 / begining of 1999 with focus on my TI-86.

It was published in Jan 1999 on ticalc.org:
https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/76/7608.html

I'm releasing the source code, as is. It was compiled with DJGPP.

I developed compiler because all other compilers I tried generated very bloated code.
On top of that I ended up adding support for a DLL system.

More information in https://github.com/nunojay/tisco/blob/master/doc/TISCO.txt .

May it be of any use to anyone.
