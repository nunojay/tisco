# tisco
Old z80 simple C compiler for TI based calculators.

This project was developed in 3 or 4 months at the end of 1998, with focus on my TI-86.

It was published (no source) in Jan 1999 on ticalc.org:<br/>
https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/76/7608.html

I'm releasing the source code, as is. It was compiled with DJGPP.

I developed it because all other compilers I tried generated very bloated code.
On top of that I ended up adding support for a DLL system.

Full user manual at<br/>

The manual above anotated with implementation information, since it was for beta testers, at<br/>
https://github.com/nunojay/tisco/blob/master/doc/TISCObt.txt<br/>
and some high level implementation description at<br/>
https://github.com/nunojay/tisco/blob/master/doc/README.DEV<br/>

May it be of any use to anyone.
